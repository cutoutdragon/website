# Welcome to the ending to "The Floating Islet"

On this page I'll cover how I generated a lot of the graphics used throughout the game. For the most part, I used the defaults that came with RPGMaker MV and then transformed the graphics. There are a lot of ways to do this! But, I do think the way I did it is pretty cool and novel. See for yourself below.

### Getting Started

The general premise of what I'll be walking you through is running an Android Emulator that can different image processing Apps. There are already a few that exist on Mac OS/Windows natively, but somehow they're not quite as good as the ones I've found on phones. The other option being to set up your own deep learning neural art machine, I also recommend that if you have the processing power and the time.

- To begin, you will need to [download the program "BlueStacks"](https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html?utm_campaign=homepage-dl-button-en). This covers the Android emulator part and will let you run different Android apps directly from your desktop. ![Image](https://github.com/cutoutdragon/website/blob/master/bluestackIcon.png)
  
- Secondly, you will need to install an app like [Sketch Photo Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.photovideotools.sketch.photo) or [Prisma](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.neuralprisma) or [Philm](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=philm.vilo.im&hl=en_US). Just a few of the decent artsy photo generators out there. You can either use the BlueStacks search engine or download an APK to install into BlueStacks.

- Note: BlueStacks might give you a bunch of warnings about updates and things it needs to run to use any of these apps. Do whatever it tells you to do, it should work out.


### Navigating Prisma

I have a number of step-by-step screenshots and instructions to guide you through uploading, generating, and downloading your photos.

Step 1:
Launch your app, i.e. Prisma

Step 2:
Click on the little icon in the bottom left, this lets you select an image instead of taking a photo.

Step 3:
This will launch a poorly sized little window, click on the Import from Windows button and just pick any photo. You can upload things properly later, this is just a hack to get to the proper screen.

Step 4:
Now that you uploaded something, BlueStacks opens up your actual image gallery. This should be probalby sized and you can easily select uploading and downloading images.

Step 5: 
Select an image. Notice that there is a little Prisma button you can hit to send it directly into the app.
